Get The Lead Out was a team project put together by a cross-functional team of designers, data scientists, and software engineers during a coding sprint hosted by the U.S. Census Bureau as a part of its program, The Opportunity Project.

I served as the Engineering Lead on this project where I focused on choosing the tech stack, planning timelines, and ensuring smooth transition between teams, in addition to coding.
